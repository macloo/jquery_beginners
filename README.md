jQuery Beginners
================

This small group of files is for students who have just started learning jQuery (in a course for journalism students). It follows their out-of-class use of Code School's free [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/) course, parts 1-3 of 5 parts. So the code does not include anything other than what is taught in those first three modules.

These exercises go along with a PowerPoint, [Beginning jQuery](http://www.slideshare.net/macloo/j-query-review1), in which I go over some background about jQuery and also review the concepts from the three Code School modules.

Instructions for five of the exercises are in the file scripts/myjquery.js (as comments). Since Code School does not have us using real files, the purpose of the exercises is to have students apply what they learned to actual files:

+ index.html
+ styles/main.css
+ scripts/myjquery.js

The file scripts/template.js is not used in the exercises; it's just there so that students can copy it if they want to.

## A photo gallery of sorts

The last exercise (6) uses a different HTML file, but the same CSS and JS files:

+ photos.html
+ styles/main.css
+ scripts/myjquery.js

This represents a photo gallery that can be built using only the information from parts 1-3 in the Try jQuery course. The students will need some encouragement to deconstruct the code and figure out how it works.

This basic (and flawed) photo gallery is enhanced in the repo [jQuery Photo Gallery](https://github.com/macloo/jquery-photo-gallery).
